“The root cause of wandering in the city of samsara is coarse, sinful food.
If you abandon it and enjoy the food of Contemplation,
The body of Bodhi mind will grow day by day.
May you quickly attain the state of the three supreme enlightenments.”

If one practices these nine levels of essence extraction of the three kāyas, the benefits are inconceivable. Most diseases generally arise from food; relying on Extracting the Essence of the Three Kāyas is one of the best ways to eliminate them.

For the time being, the need for food and clothing is eliminated, and one's desire for the wealth, possessions, and enjoyments of this life's saṃsāra is completely reversed. By exhausting the desire for attachment to this life's saṃsāra, one grasps the path to liberation in future lives. Through this, all virtue one does becomes a cause for liberation.

Ultimately, one no longer needs to spend the most vital part of life on saṃsāric activities for the sake of food. This creates the opportunity to practice the Dharma one has heard and to cultivate meditation, which progresses higher and higher. As meditation develops, realization gradually arises in one's mindstream, leading to the attainment of Buddhahood.

Shardza Rinpoche said: “Wandering in saṃsāra is due to not cutting the attachment and clinging to food. Who does not implicitly understand that if the attachment to food is cut, there is no other cause for saṃsāra? Therefore, for the sake of food, saṃsāric beings accumulate negativity, suffering, and bad talk, and spend their entire life's aspirations on it. There is nothing more ignorant than wasting future enlightenment. So, if there is someone who relies on such advice and primarily focuses only on future enlightenment, it is like the udumbara lotus among flowers—a very wonderful thing.”
