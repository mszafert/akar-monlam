## The collections of the basic knowledge of Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen

Brief Explanation:

Understanding dharma terminology is crucial, as a single word can have multiple meanings depending
on the teaching level. Clear definitions are necessary to avoid misunderstanding and to analyze
and comprehend teachings properly. Knowing provisional definitions and definienda provides a solid
foundation for receiving teachings and enriches the practice experience.
