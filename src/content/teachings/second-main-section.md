I will teach each of the forty-two secret essential points of the Tӧgal from Heart Drops of Küntu
Zangpo, that are able to achieve the result of the three bodies of enlightenment in one life and one
body, explained one by one as stated in the root text. Practitioners who have been seized by these
special oral instructions will naturally purify all the appearances of saṃsāra, which are deluded
appearances, and naturally seize the natural ground of awareness in the body of the great
transference of the body in the space of the original purity of the ground." Geshe Gelek Therefore,
Geshe Tenzin Gelek welcomes all fortunate disciples, wherever they are, who wish to engage properly
in the practice of the Great Perfection of Tögal.

Sessions include time for teaching, questions, answers, and guided group meditations.

This material will be presented in a way that is open to those who are both brand new to learning
Dzogchen and/or the Yungdrung Bön tradition and those who have practice experience.

### Liberation Through Meditation: The Explanation of the Path of Thögal

Topic

How Thögal Is Superior To Trekchö in Terms of Seven Essential Points.

1. Establishing Certainty With the Essential Points of the Secret Instructions.
2. The Essential Points of the Body, Speech, and Mind.
3. The Essential Point of the Arising at the Door.
4. The Essential Point of the Basis of Arising of the Objects
5. The Essential Point of Slowing the Winds and Rigpa.
6. The Four Special Great Channels.
7. The Four Magical Lamps.
8. Where the Rigpa, Abides.
9. The Four Great Visions.
10. The Five Primordial Wisdoms Are Actualized
11. The Three Secret Syllables Are Displayed to the Mind.
12. The Attaining Free Entrance.
13. The Three Immoveables.
14. Three Stabilities.
15. The Four Attainments
16. The Four Confidences
17. The Four Wisdoms.

This is all of the 42 essential points of the luminous Thögal practice, which was taught by Küntu
Zangpo, and which the Khandromas bound them in coded verses. The past experts were not able to
decode and explain them. I (Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen Rinpoche) have had the fortune to do this.
Now Geshe Tenzin Gelek Rinpoche will give a clear and concise explanation of this topic, using
the words of the text. Therefore, please consider this.
