### The main points of the Second lamp

The Lamp of the Flesh Heart, which is the essential point of where the base of self-knowing Rigpa
is and how it arises within.

1. The Universal Ground and Rigpa do not reach the limits of cyclic existence and transcendence of
   suffering
2. The Way the Universal Ground and Rigpa Abide
3. How the Universal Ground and Rigpa pervade the body
4. How the Intellect Arises
5. How the Body and Mind Combine and Separate
