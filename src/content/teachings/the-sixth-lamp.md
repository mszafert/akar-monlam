### The main points of the Sixth Lamp

The Lamp of the Time of the Bardo, which is the essential point of reaching the border of delusion and realization and the way cyclic existence and transcendence of suffering separate. 

1. How the body and mind separate.
2. How liberation comes from realization: How those of superior faculties are liberated, how those of middling faculties are liberated, and how those of lesser faculties are liberated.
3. How delusion comes from non-realization.
