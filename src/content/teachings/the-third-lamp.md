### The main points of the Third Lamp

The Lamp of the Smooth White Channel is the key instruction on the arising of all-pervasive
primordial wisdom through the path of the central channel.

1. How the body and mind are generated in the mother's womb through the five elements.
2. How the three channels and six chakras are formed.
3. How the five organs, five sense powers, the limbs and secondary limbs arise.
4. How the branch channels and secondary channels divide.
5. How Primordial Wisdom arises in the path of the central channel.
